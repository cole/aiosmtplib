Changelog
=========

2.0.2
-----

- Bugfix: don't send extra EHLO/HELO before QUIT (credit @ikrivosheev)
- Change: added SMTPConnectionResponseError for invalid response on
  connect only (credit @ikrivosheev)

2.0.1
-----

- Bugfix: "tests" and "docs" in the sdist should be includes, not packages,
  so that they do not get put in ``site-packages``.


2.0.0
-----

- **BREAKING**: Drop Python 3.5 and 3.6 support.
- **BREAKING**: On connect, if the server supports STARTTLS, automatically try
  to upgrade the connection. STARTTLS after connect can be turned on or off
  explicitly by passing ``start_tls=True`` or ``start_tls=False`` respectively.
- **BREAKING**: Remove deprecated ``loop`` keyword argument for the SMTP class.
- Change: The ``source_address`` argument now takes a (addr, port) tuple that is
  passed as the ``local_addr`` param to ``asyncio.create_connection``, allowing
  for binding to a specific IP. The new ``local_hostname`` argument that takes
  the value to be sent to the server with the EHLO/HELO message. This behaviour
  more closely matches ``smtplib``.

  In order to not break existing usage, passing a string instead of a tuple to
  ``source_address`` will give a DeprecationWarning, and use the value as it if
  had been passed for ``local_hostname``.

  Thanks @rafaelrds and @davidmcnabnz for raising and contributing work on this
  issue.
- Bugfix: the ``mail_options`` and ``rcpt_options`` arguments to the ``send``
  coroutine no longer cause errors
- Cleanup: Refactored ``SMTP`` parent classes to remove complex inheritance
  structure.
- Cleanup: Switched to ``asyncio.run`` for sync client methods.
- Cleanup: Don't use private email.message.Message policy attribute (instead,
  set an appropriate policy based on message class)


1.1.7
-----

- Security: Fix a possible injection vulnerability (a variant of
  https://consensys.net/diligence/vulnerabilities/python-smtplib-multiple-crlf-injection/)

  Note that in order to exploit this vulnerability in aiosmtplib, the attacker would need
  control of the ``hostname`` or ``source_address`` parameters. Thanks Sam Sanoop @ Snyk
  for bringing this to my attention.
- Bugfix: include CHANGLOG in sdist release
- Type hints: fix type hints for async context exit (credit @JelleZijlstra)

1.1.3
-----

- Feature: add pause and resume writing methods to ``SMTPProcotol``, via
  ``asyncio.streams.FlowControlMixin`` (thanks @ikrivosheev).

- Bugfix: allow an empty sender (credit @ikrivosheev)

- Cleanup: more useful error message when login called without TLS

-----

- Feature: Added send coroutine api.

- Feature: Added SMTPUTF8 support for UTF8 chars in addresses.

- Feature: Added connected socket and Unix socket path connection options.

- Cleanup: Use built in start_tls method on Python 3.7+.

- Cleanup: Timeout correctly if TLS handshake takes too long on Python 3.7+.

  usage to remove deprecation warnings in 3.8.

- Bugfix: EHLO/HELO if required before any command, not just when using
  higher level commands.

- Cleanup: Replaced asserts in functions with more useful errors (e.g.
  RuntimeError).

- Cleanup: More useful error messages for timeouts (thanks ikrivosheev!),
  including two new exception classes, ``SMTPConnectTimeoutError`` and
  ``SMTPReadTimeoutError``


1.0.6

  instead of SMTPServerDisconnected


1.0.1
-----

- Bugfix: Commands were getting out of order when using the client as a context
  manager within a task

- Bugfix: multiple tasks calling connect would get confused

- Bugfix: EHLO/HELO responses were being saved even after disconnect

- Bugfix: RuntimeError on client cleanup if event loop was closed

- Bugfix: CRAM-MD5 auth was not working
